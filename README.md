# BuddyPress Mute

Muting a user results in that member's activity items being removed from the site-wide activity stream. Members can be unmuted at any time.

There are many reasons why you might want to mute a person. A friend could be posting too many promotional messages or a former colleague might be regularly talking about work projects. In many of these situations, blocking or unfriending aren't appropriate solutions because you don't want to dissociate yourself from that person.

## Screenshots

A mute button is displayed next to each member in the loop (see screenshot) and on each member's profile page.

## Requirements

 - WordPress 3.5 or higher
 - BuddyPress 1.7 or higher

The plugin may work with earlier versions but I haven't tested.
