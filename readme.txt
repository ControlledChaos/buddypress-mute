Allow members to mute their friends and shed unwanted items from their BuddyPress activity stream.

== Description ==

Muting a person results in that person's activity items being removed from the activity stream. Members can be unmuted at any time.

You might want to mute a friend because they are posting too many promotional messages or a former colleague because they are regularly talking about work projects. In many situations, blocking or unfriending a person isn't an appropriate solutions because you don't want to dissociate yourself from that person.
